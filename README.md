Denys Dvornik Tech Test for checklab

Hi!

 Thank you for really interesting tech task. I want to attract your attiontion to some details below:
 
 1. If needed I can provide you my API KEY for ChatGPT to check how works ChatGPT module.;
 2. Even if you will not use API Key program will normally work with Faker generator.;
 3. I prefer to use webdriver-manager to simplify the path-problems with chrome and firefox. It will download more dependences and take a little bit more time,
 sorry for that);
 4. I tried and continue trying to do the last task - docker support. But now I faced with problem with my system, because I use Mac m1 and webdrivers don't
 support arm64 system in the right way yet. I'll try to use another device and system to finish it too, but due to lack of time I want to show you my
 solution of the main task + ChatGPT task. So Dockerfile and docker-compose here is only for me, because I'll finish this task in future just for myself);
 5. It's very simply to improve my LinkedIn bot and make it more convinient for users. I see next ways:
 - Add the opportunity to input differend users data;
 - Make as a Telegram bot;
 - Different browsers and docker support;
 - More detailing Chat GPT support
 
 How to use this bot:
 - Clone git repo https://github.com/DenisPyProCourse/LinkedIn_bot.git
 - pip install - r requirements.txt
 - python main.py
 That script will launch the program, after that you should choose browser.
 
 Thanks & Best regards
 Denys
